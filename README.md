## FSA (Fisheries Stock Assessment)  <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="150" width="150" alt="FSA logo" />

The **FSA** package provides R functions to conduct typical introductory fisheries analyses. Example analyses that use **FSA** can be found in the [Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R book](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/pages/books.html#introductory-fisheries-analyses-with-r) (*see note below*) and on the [fishR website](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/). Please [cite **FSA**](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSA//authors.html) if you use **FSA** in a publication.

### Note about **FSA** and *Introduction to Fisheries Analysis with R* book
Versions of **FSA** beginning with v0.9.0 may no longer work as shown in the IFAR book. Many functions have not changed from when the book was published, but some have. Thus, you will need to install an **FSA** version before v0.9.0 to be assured that functions work as described in the IFAR book.
