\title{Creates a function for a specific parameterization of the von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, Richards, and logistic growth functions.}
\usage{
makeGrowthFun(
  type = c("von Bertalanffy", "Gompertz", "logistic", "Richards"),
  param = 1,
  simple = FALSE,
  msg = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{A string (\dQuote{von Bertalanffy}, \dQuote{Gompertz}, \dQuote{logistic}, \dQuote{Richards}) that indicates the type of growth function to show.}

\item{param}{A single numeric that indicates the specific parameterization of the growth function. See details.}

\item{simple}{A logical that indicates whether the function will accept all parameter values in the first parameter argument (\code{=FALSE}; DEFAULT) or whether all individual parameters must be specified in separate arguments (\code{=TRUE}).}

\item{msg}{A logical that indicates whether a message about the growth function and parameter definitions should be output (\code{=TRUE}; DEFAULT) or not (\code{=FALSE}).}

\item{case}{A numeric that indicates the specific case of the Schnute function to use. See details.}

\item{plot}{A logical that indicates whether the growth function expression should be shown as an equation in a simple plot.}

\item{\dots}{Not implemented.}
}
\value{
Return a function that can be used to predict fish size given a vector of ages and values for the growth function parameters and, in some parameterizations, values for constants. The result should be saved to an object that is then the function name. When the resulting function is used, the parameters are ordered as shown when the definitions of the parameters are printed after the function is called (if \code{msg=TRUE}). If \code{simple=FALSE} (DEFAULT), then the values for all parameters may be included as a vector in the first parameter argument (but in the same order). Similarly, the values for all constants may be included as a vector in the first constant argument (i.e., \code{t1}). If \code{simple=TRUE}, then all parameters and constants must be declared individually. The resulting function is somewhat easier to read when \code{simple=TRUE}, but is less general for some applications.

An expression of the equation for each growth function may be created with \code{growthFunShow}. In this function \code{type=} is used to select the major function type (e.g., von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, Richards, Logistic, Schnute) and \code{param=} is used to select a specific parameterization of that growth function. If \code{plot=TRUE}, then a simple graphic will be created with the equation using \code{\link{plotmath}} for a pretty format.

\description{
Creates a function for a specific parameterizations of the von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, Richards, and logistic growth functions. Use \code{growthFunShow()} to see the equations for each growth function.
}
\note{
Take note of the following for parameterizations (i.e., \code{param}) of each growth function:
\itemize{
  \item von Bertalanffy
  \itemize{
    \item The \sQuote{Original} and \sQuote{vonBertalanffy} are synonymous as are \sQuote{Typical}, \sQuote{Traditional}, and \sQuote{BevertonHolt}. Further note that the \sQuote{Ogle} parameterization has the \sQuote{Original}/\sQuote{vonBertalanffy} and \sQuote{Typical}/\sQuote{Traditional}/\sQuote{BevertonHolt} parameterizations as special cases.
  }
  \item Gompertz
  \itemize{
    \item The \sQuote{Ricker2} and \sQuote{QuinnDeriso1} are synonymous, as are \sQuote{Ricker3} and \sQuote{QuinnDeriso2}.
    \item The parameterizations and parameters for the Gompertz function are varied and confusing in the literature. I have attempted to use a uniform set of parameters in these functions, but that makes a direct comparison to the literature difficult. Common sources for Gompertz models are listed in the references below. I make some comments here to aid comparisons to the literature.
    \item Within FSA, L0 is the mean length at age 0, Linf is the mean asymptotic length, ti is the age at the inflection point, gi is the instantaneous growth rate at the inflection point, t0 is a the hypothetical age at a mean length of 0, and a, b, and c are nuisance parameters with no real-world interpretations.
    \item The function in Ricker (1975)[p. 232] is the same as \sQuote{Ricker2} where the a parameter here is equal to G there and the gi parameter here is equal to the g parameter there. Also note that their w is L here.
    \item In the Ricker (1979)[p. 705] functions (the \sQuote{RickerX} functions), the a parameter here is equal to k there and the gi parameter here is equal to the g parameter there. Also note that their w is L here. In the Ricker (1979) functions as presented in Campana and Jones (1992), the a parameter here is equal to k parameter there and the gi parameter here is equal to the G parameter there. Also note that their X is L here.
    \item In the Quinn and Deriso (1999) functions (the \sQuote{QuinnDerisoX} functions), the a parameter here is equal to lambda/K there and the gi parameter here is equal to the K parameter there. Also note that their Y is L here.
    \item The function in Quist \emph{et al.} (2012)[p. 714] is the same as \sQuote{Ricker1} where the gi parameter here is equal to the G parameter there and the ti parameter here is equal to the t0 parameter there.
    \item The function in Katsanevakis and Maravelias (2008) is the same as \sQuote{Ricker1} where the gi parameter here is equal to the k2 parameter there and the ti parameter here is equal to the t2 parameter there.
  }
  \item Richards
  \itemize{
    \item Only 4-parameter parameterizations from Tjorve and Tjorve (2010) that seemed useful for modeling fish growth are provided here.
    \item Within FSA, Linf is the mean asymptotic length; ti is the age at the inflection point; k controls the slope at the inflection point (maximum relative growth rate); a is dimensionless but related to the horizontal position (i.e., age) of the inflection point; b, c, and d are dimensionless but related to the vertical position (i.e., size) of the inflection point; and L0 is the mean length at age-0.
    \item The parameterizations (1-5) correspond to functions/equations 5, 3(alt), 7, 4, and 6, respectively, in Tjorve and Tjorve (2010). Note that their A, S, k are Linf, a, k and their d is b, c, and d, respectively, here (in FSA).
  }
  \item logistic
  \itemize{
    \item Within FSA, L0 is the mean length at age 0, Linf is the mean asymptotic length, ti is the age at the inflection point, and gninf is the instantaneous growth rate at negative infinity.
